# EthernetCommunication

This is my EthernetCommunication task. That is supposed to simulate ethernet communication. 
There is an EthernetFrame which holds the frame of the ethernet and EthernetDriver
that constructs the frames needed and receives the frame. The Protocol sends the frames using the driver
so that ethernet communication can happen.

This is built in C++ to build this program make sure you are in the EthernetCommunication directory
then in the terminal run 'make clean' to clean up any existing files then run 'make' to compile 
the files and then ./main to run the program.
